# Exploring Audio Icons for Content-Based Navigation in Voice User Interfaces
A CUI'23 Paper


## Study Objective

Explore the effectiveness of audio icons in enhancing voice navigation of how-to videos.

## Methodology

Participants assembled a wooden robot using an instructional video with a VUI-controlled laptop and augmented playback audio icon controls.

## Conditions

Three conditions were tested:

1. **No audio icons**
2. **Audio icons placed alongside action points**
3. **Audio icons placed at fixed 30-second intervals**

## Findings

- Audio icons significantly improved usability compared to no audio icons (Condition 1 vs. Condition 2).
- No significant difference between Condition 2 and Condition 3, and Condition 1 and Condition 3, suggesting that temporal placement alone did not enhance user experience.
- Participants struggled to associate audio icons with visual content, leading to underutilization in Condition 3.
- Different preferences for start and stop features - some participants paused the video, while others multitasked.

## Design Recommendations

- Develop VUI-first global features to offer a wide range of voice commands, enhancing user control.
- Implement a user-created bookmark feature for personalized anchor points.
- Support user expectations in navigation and enable the VUI to understand and remember context.

## Conclusion

Audio icons improve voice navigation of how-to videos, but challenges in associating them with video content need to be addressed. Design recommendations aim to enhance VUI-based navigation experiences.
