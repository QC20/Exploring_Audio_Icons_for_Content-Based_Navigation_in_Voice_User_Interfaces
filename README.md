# Exploring Audio Icons for Content-Based Navigation in Voice User Interfaces
![A CUI'23 Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3571884.3604302)

## Abstract
Voice interaction is an increasingly popular technology, allowing users to control devices and applications without the need for physical interaction or ocular attention. Augmented voice playback control features, such as audio icons, have the potential to significantly improve voice navigation for instructional videos. This study evaluates audio icons for improving how-to video navigation in a Wizard-of-Oz-controlled setup with 24 participants assembling a wooden robot using a voice-controlled laptop. Results showed that audio icons helped participants complete the task faster, with fewer voice commands, and higher satisfaction. However, some usability challenges were observed. Significant differences in perceived usability were found between audio icons placed with visual points-of-action and the baseline, but not between the baseline and audio icons at 30-second intervals. These findings provide valuable insights for VUI system researchers and designers to advance the use of audio icons for improving voice interface navigation.

## Study Objective
Explore the effectiveness of audio icons in enhancing voice navigation of how-to videos.

## Methodology
Participants assembled a wooden robot using an instructional video with a VUI-controlled laptop and augmented playback audio icon controls.

## Conditions
Three conditions were tested:

1. **No audio icons**
2. **Audio icons placed alongside action points**
3. **Audio icons placed at fixed 30-second intervals**

## Findings
- Audio icons significantly improved usability compared to no audio icons (Condition 1 vs. Condition 2).
- No significant difference between Condition 2 and Condition 3, and Condition 1 and Condition 3, suggesting that temporal placement alone did not enhance user experience.
- Participants struggled to associate audio icons with visual content, leading to underutilization in Condition 3.
- Different preferences for start and stop features - some participants paused the video, while others multitasked.

## Design Recommendations
- Develop VUI-first global features to offer a wide range of voice commands, enhancing user control.
- Implement a user-created bookmark feature for personalized anchor points.
- Support user expectations in navigation and enable the VUI to understand and remember context.

## Conclusion
Audio icons improve voice navigation of how-to videos, but challenges in associating them with video content need to be addressed. Design recommendations aim to enhance VUI-based navigation experiences.
